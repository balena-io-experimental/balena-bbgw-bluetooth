# BeagleBone Green Wireless Bluetooth setup

This is an example project of installing the Bluetooth firmware
on a BeagleBone Green Wireless (BBGW) device, setting up the
onboard Bluetooth device, and scan for neirby devices to check
functionality.

This project should provide a reasonable basis for building your
own Bluetooth enabled resin.io application with BBGW.

The firmware and system files are imported from
https://github.com/rcn-ee/repos/tree/master/bb-wl18xx-firmware/suite/jessie/debian
and might need to update from there, when out of date in this repo!
